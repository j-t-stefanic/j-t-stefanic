## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm John Stefanic and while I'm currently employed by an importer and distributor of fine wines and spirits, on the weekends I'm a Data Science enthusiast and wine lover.    

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards the Google Associate Data Practitioner Certificate. 
 ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also creating my Project Portfolio to showcase my diversified skillset that has been honed over decades.
 âš¡ Fun fact: I've published articles on Medium.com and constantly kick around the idea of writing a book.  
 âš¡ Fun fact: On weekends in the Spring, Summer, and Fall I'm often playing Volleyball on the sand courts.
