## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**I'm John Stefanic and while I'm currently employed by an importer and distributor of fine wines and spirits, on the weekends I'm a Data Sciences enthusiast.    

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the Google Associate Data Practitioner Certificate. 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m also creating my Project Portfolio to showcase my diversified skillset that has been honed over decades.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've published articles on Medium.com and constantly kick around the idea of writing a book.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: On the weekends I'm often playing Volleyball on the sand courts.
